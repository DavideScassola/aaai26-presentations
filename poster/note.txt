The Problem
Data is precious but often sensitive.
Synthetic data is the solution: share similar and useful data but preserving privacy

Data -> Synthetic Data -> People
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Relational data is a graph
Records are nodes
foreign key references are edges
IIDs are the connected compenents

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But generating synthetic relational data is difficult!

Current methods fails at:
- modelling relationships between any record indirectly connected
- adapting to any foreign key topology
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Graph-Conditional generation:
- Sample the graph structure with a scalable method
- Use flow matching (deep generative modelling) to "fill" the empty graph with the features
- Use a GNN for flow matching

Maximally expressive: any record in the same connected component is modelled jointly
Flexible: any foreign key graph can be used
Scalable: no need for instantiating (or generating) the edge matrix

(Variational) Flow Matching

Generation: solving an ODE that maps noise into data
Training: learn the vector field guiding the ODE by denoising samples with added noise (same as diffusion)

with variational FM a denoising distribution is learned: $p()$
denoiser can be a fully factorized distribution!

Flow Matching for relational data

Training:
    Image: sample subgraph from data -> add random noise (according to probability path, sample t) -> denoise -> loss

Generation:
    Image: sample empty foreign key graph -> fill with random noise -> solve ode by repeatedly applying denoiser -> graph sample


with variational FM a denoising distribution is learned: $p()$
denoiser can be a fully factorized distribution!
